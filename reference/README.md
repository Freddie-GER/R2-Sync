# Reference Implementations

This directory contains reference implementations from the [syncall](https://github.com/bergercookie/syncall) project, which provides various calendar and task synchronization implementations.

These implementations are kept for reference purposes when implementing additional sync capabilities in our CalDAV Instance-Based Sync project. They are not actively used in our codebase but serve as valuable examples for:

- CalDAV sync implementation patterns
- Google Calendar sync approaches
- Notion integration and block-based sync
- Handling of recurring events
- State management and conflict resolution

## Available Implementations

1. **CalDAV Sync**: Basic CalDAV calendar synchronization implementation
2. **Google Integration**: 
   - Google Calendar sync
   - Google Keep notes and todos
   - Google Tasks integration
3. **Notion Integration**:
   - Block-based data model
   - Page and database synchronization
   - Task management implementation
